Headphones Landing Page
Project Description
This project is a responsive landing page for Headphones, a fictional company, built from scratch using HTML and CSS, with minimal JavaScript (used only for the hamburger menu in Task 8). The design, created by Nicolas Philippot (UI/UX designer), was provided via Figma, and the goal was to create a pixel-perfect implementation without relying on external CSS frameworks like Bootstrap. The project showcases my skills in front-end web development, focusing on HTML, CSS, responsive design, and accessibility, as part of the ALX Front-End Web Development program.

About the Landing Page
The Headphones landing page is a visually appealing, fully functional web page designed to promote the company’s products and services. It features a clean, modern layout with a header/hero section, “What we do…” section, “Our results” section, a contact form, and a footer. The page is responsive, switching to a mobile layout at 480px or less, and includes subtle animations to enhance user experience. The design adheres to accessibility best practices and uses custom fonts (Source Sans Pro, Spin Cycle OT) and font icons for a polished look.

Max Content Width: 1000px, centered on the page.
Accessibility: Built with semantic HTML and accessibility best practices.
No External Frameworks: Built entirely with vanilla HTML and CSS (except for Task 8’s JavaScript).
